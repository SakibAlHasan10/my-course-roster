# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
- In this my assignment  project, I managed state through react useState and useEffect hooks. I maintained various state variable to track application data and usear interactions. These included data fetched from APIs, user inpute, and UI-related states like visibility toggles. I using useState initialize and update these variable based on user action asynconus data fetching. Additionally, I employed the useEffect hook to fetch and update data when the component mounted or when specific dependencies change.
This allowed for daynamic rendering of components and responsive use expriences, Overll, I leveraged react's built-in state management capabillities to efficiently handeldata UI changes in my project.
