# Discuss how you managed the state in your assignment project.
- In this my assignment project, I managed state through react useState and useEffect hooks. I maintained various state variable to track application data and user interactions. These included data fetched from APIs, user input, and UI-related states like visibility toggles. I using useState initialize and update these variable based on user action asynchronous data fetching. Additionally, I employed the useEffect hook to fetch and update data when the component mounted or when specific dependencies change. This allowed for dynamic rendering of components and responsive use experiences, Overly, I leveraged react's built-in state management capabilities to efficiently handel data UI changes in my project.
